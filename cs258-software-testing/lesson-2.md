# Lesson 2: Coverage Testing

* Partioning the Input Domain
  * Create a class of inputs that proves some output is correct 
* Test coverage
  * "Measure of proportion of program exercised during testing"
  * Function coverage
    * how many functions are executed during test run?
  * Pros
    * Objective score
    * When coverage is < 100%, we are given meaninful tasks
  * Cons
    * Not good at finding errors of omission
    * Difficult to interpret scores < 100%
    * 100% coverage doesn't mean all bugs are found
